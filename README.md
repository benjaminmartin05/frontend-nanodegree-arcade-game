Students should use this [rubric](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd001/l-2696458597/m-2687128535) for self-checking their submission.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

README.md should contain instructions on how to load and play the game (you will need to add those instructions).

## Instructions:
* To load the game, open the index.html file.
* The directional pad (up, down, left, right) on your computer will be used to move your player during the game.
* The player will not have the ability to move off the game board.

## Playing the game:
* The object is to move the player from the starting point to the water without being touched by a bug.
* This would qualify as a victory and a score of 5 victories will complete the game.
* If your player makes contact with a bug, you lose, and your player is reset to the starting point.
